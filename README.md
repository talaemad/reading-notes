# Growth Mindset
It's about believing that the effort to learn something will make you good in it, not just if you are talented or smart more. Of course, being smart and talented will help but without effort, you will stay in your place without moving while the world moving. it's exactly like the story we heard while we were children about the rabbit and the turtle, and how the turtle win in the end because it kept trying.

### Three  reminders to myself:
- reading is always the solution to know better.
- don't look where the people stand and focus on where you stand.
- don't wait for the miracle to happen.
