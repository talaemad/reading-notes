## COLOR

* Color brings the site to life and helps evokes reactions.
* Three ways to use colors in CSS:
    * RGB values => These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up.Ex. ` color: rgb(100,100,90); `
    * hex codes => These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign.Ex.`color: #ee3e80;`
    * color name => There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers.Ex. ` color: DarkCyan; `
* Backgrounf color: By default, most browser windows have a white background, but browser users can set a background color for their windows, so if you want to be sure that the background is white you can use the background-color property on the \<body> element. `background-color: rgb(200,200,200);`

* Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.
* When picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be legible.
* CSS3 introduces an entirely new and intuitive way to specify colors using hue, saturation, and lightness values.
    * hue =>This is expressed as an angle(between 0 and 360 degrees)
    * saturation => This is expressed as a percentage.
    * lightness => This is expressed as a percentage with 0% being white, 50% being normal, and 100% being black.
  
* CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
* CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.
