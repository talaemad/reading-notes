# How Computers Work!

## What Makes a Computer, a Computer?

* Input => what the user does to get the output or to make the computer startworking.
* Storage => everything that comes from input its information will be stored on the memory.
* Processing => taking the information from memory and work on it.
* Output => the information that been processed (the result) will display in different forms.

## Binary & Data

* Inside a computer are electric wires and circuits that carry all the information in a computer.
* a bit, the smallest piece of information a computer can store. and it's on/offstate of a single wire.
* binary number system, we only have two digits: zero and one.
* there is a way to convert between the decimal system to a binary system.
* all types of text, video, and sounds could be present on numbers so we can convert it to binary.

## Circuits and Logic 

* a computer uses millions of tiny electronic components, which come together to form circuits to can modify and process information that's represented in ones and zeros.


## CPU, Memory, Input & Output

* input devices that take input from the outside world and convert it into binary information.
* memory to store this information.
* central processing unit or CPU,where all the calculations are done.
* output devices that take information and convert it into a physical output.
* The more complicated a task is and the more information that is input or output,the more processing power and memory a computer needs.

## Hardware and Software

* When you look inside a computing device you see a bunch of circuits, chips, wires, speakers, plugs, and all sorts of other stuff. This is the hardware.
* what you don't see is the software. Software is all of the computer programs, or code, running on this machine.
* The software can be anything from apps and games to webpages and data science software.

### But how do the hardware and the software interact with one another?

* Let's start at looking at a computer's central processing unit, or CPU is the master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer.
* CPU needs to do different things so inside it has smaller, simpler parts that handle specific tasks. It has circuits to do simple math and logic, and other circuits to send and receive information to and from different parts of the computer.
* The CPU receives simple commands that tell it which circuit to use to do a specific job.
* Programming languages like these let you type in commands in something that looks a lot like English.
* Software tells the CPU what to do,
* The operating system of the computer is the master program that manages how software gets to use the hardware of the computer, is a program with special abilities that let it control the other software on the computer.
