# JavaScript

* JavaScript allows you to make web pages more interactive by accessing and modifying the content and markup used on a web page while it is being viewed in the browser.

* JavaScript encompasses many of the traditional rules of programming. It can make the web page feel interactive by responding to what the user does.

* Note: Being able to change the content of an HTML page while it is loaded in the browser is very powerful. 
**Examples:**
* Access the content of the page.
* Modify the content of the page.
* Program rules or instructions the browser can follow.
* React to events triggered by the user or browser.

* A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.
* Scripts are made up of instructions a computer can follow step-by-step.
* a browser may use different parts of the script depending on how the user interacts with the web page.
* Scripts can rin different sections of the code in response to the situation around them.
* To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.
* Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps.

1. DEFINE THE GOAL:  you need to define the task you want to
achieve. You can think of this as a puzzle for the computer to solve.
2. DESIGN THE SCRIPT: To design a script you split the goal out into a series of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this
puzzle. This can be represented using a flowchart. You can then write down individual steps that the computer needs to perform in order to complete each individual task (and any information it needs to perform the task), rather like writing a recipe that it can follow.
3. CODE EACH STEP: Each of the steps needs to be written in a programming language that the computer understands. In our case, this is JavaScript.

* Computers are very logical and obedient. They need to be told every detail of what th ey are expected to do, and they will do it w ithout question.

* You need to learn to "think" like a computer because they solve tasks in different ways than you or I might approach them.

* Often scripts will need to perform different tasks in different situations. You can use flowcharts to work out how the tasks fit together. The flowcharts show the paths between each step.

* An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking
there are two types of expressions.

* EXPRESS IO NS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE.
` var color = 'beige'; `
* EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE.
` var area = 3 * 2; `  
The area will be 6.

* Operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.

* JavaScript contains the following mathematical operators, which you can use with numbers. [+,-,*,/,++,--,%]

* Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).

* To create a Function, you give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces. This is known as a function declaration.

* CAlling Function: you can then execute all of the statements between its curly braces with just one line code.

* Sometimes a function needs specific information to perform its task. In such cases, when you declare the function you give it parameters. Inside the function, the parameters act like variables.

* when you call a function that has parameters, you specify the values it should use in the parentheses that follow its name. The values are called **arguments**, and they can be provided as values or variables. 
* some functions return information to the code that called them. For example, when they perform calculations, they return the result.
