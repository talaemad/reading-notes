# Java Script (JS)
* document.write('the msg'); => this to write on the html page.
 document => is object , write => method of document 
 * It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript
file. 
* JavaScript files are text files, but they have the(.js) extension.
* The HTML \<\script\> element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file. 
* If you view the source code of the page in the browser, the JS will not have changed the HTML, because it works with the model of the web page that the browser has created.

* The data type used=> numbers. strings, and true or false(Booleans).
* note: string must be between ('') or ("") but not combine between them.
* \+ => use for Concatenation.
* all mathematical operations could be used on all the numeric data types.
* The variable changes as the type as the value.

### Rules for name the variable

* The first character must be a letter or an underscore (_). You can't use a number as the first character.
* The rest of the variable name can include any letter, any number, or the underscore. You can't use any other characters, including spaces, symbols, and punctuation marks.
* Variable names are case sensitive.
* There's no limit to the length of the variable name.
* You can't use one of JavaScript's reserved words as a variable name.
