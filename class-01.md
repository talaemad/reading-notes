## Introduction

**How the Web Work:**

* When you connect to the web, you do so via an Internet Service Provider (ISP). You type a domain name or web address into your browser to visit a site; for example: google.com.
* Your computer contacts a network of servers called Domain Name System (DNS) servers. They tell your computer the IP address associated with the requested domain name. Every device connected to the web has a unique IP address; it is like the id for that computer.
* The IP address that the DNS server returns to your computer allows your browser to contact the webserver that hosts the website you requested.
* The web server then sends the page you requested back to your web browser.

### Definition

* Web Server: is a computer that is constantly connected to the web and is set up especially to send web pages to users.
* An IP address is a number of up to 12 digits separated by periods / full stops.

## Chapter 1

* HTML pages are text documents.
* HTML uses elements to describe the structure of pages.
* There are several different elements in HTML, each element has an opening tag and a closing tag.
* Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.
* Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value, separated by an equals sign.

## Chapter 8

* There are some characters that are used in and reserved by HTML code. (For example, the left and right angled brackets.). For that if you want these characters to appear on your page you need to use what are termed "escape" characters.
