		Text Editor

When you start to be a web developer one of the most important things you need is the platform you want to use to write your code. Which is "text editor", what is the text editor? it is a piece of software that you download and install on your computer or your access online through your web browser, that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site.

In every computer, there is a text editor built-in with the operating system but a lot of web developers nowadays using a different text editor, you maybe think now why is that? It's because the features that are on the text editor will help them and you if you use them. Before talking about the features you must know that text editor it's a personal choice, in what you are comfortable with.

Some features that led web developer to choose the text editor:
1.) code completion: when you start typing will give you suggestions, and including closing tags.
2.) syntax highlighting: make the reading easier.
3.) a nice variety of themes: to be comfortable to the eye.
A lot of text editors have these features and more, and there is software that for only one type of operating system and there is the opposite. for example the text editor visual studio available for all operating systems.

ls=> shown the files and folder we have on this directory.
ls -a=> shown the files and folder we have on this directory even the hidden ones.
cd=>Change Directories: move to another directory.
